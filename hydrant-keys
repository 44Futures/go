Suit up.

That's code for get your freaking duct tape repaired nylon jacket and pants on, boot up in your Koflaks (boots), get your mittens in. Yes, mittens with sweat-wicking material inserts with nylon shells. A wrist strap and a hand strap on each so you can tug those bad boys tight on to your hands. Some guys made snow in like these Fred Flintestone gloves. Not smart. You lose air circulation around your fingers. Then they go numb. Kinda dumb.

This page is the recommended stuff you need to start dabbling at trading futures. Even just for fun. Why not? You have a lot of fun and already pay for coffee out, moronic shopping days, expensive eating out and then add on your problem. Well, we all got them. Whatever you do whether it's addictive nor not, I don't care. 
  
You can do this stuff with like a 3rd grade education. So again, the reason for the hydrant key title is because there were 4 kinds of hydrant keys on the mountain. Pretty hilarious. 

In the mid-1980's everyone was using these thin shaft water hydrants. Those get screwed into a threaded receiver which is welded (before please so you don't torch the bushings and teflon gaskets) to the pipe. Welders have a tough job on the mountain. Hey, go up on the mountain and work on high-pressured pipe even not pressurized. Make sure it doesn't leak at all, like zero leaks. 

Leaky pipes spray these huge long flumes of water and then freeze. Oh great, now there's more dangerous stuff nearby as you walk past it. Maybe see how you can make it bigger during your 12 hour shift. 

In the late '80's Matthewson came in and said damn no. Forget about those tin can hyrant valve covers. Or the dumb thin shaft that sometimes snapped in your hand trying to turn on the hydrant. Even better now. You got 910 lbs. of upline pressure that's launching a broken hydrant shaft about a truckload of feet in the air. Or worse, in your face if you're leaning over the hydrant when turning. NEVER lean over anything. No water hydrants or air valves. I worked with a kid who was kicking one during like a 5 degree night. 

The thing launched in the air along with hundreds of thousands of gallons until they could get to the pump house and shut the pumps off. Gee, there's a few days of work before we can make snow again. 

><b>So Many Different Hydrant Keys<b>

So we had the tiny hydrant shafts (key #1). Then we had the new Matthewson hydrant shafts which had a wider stem at the top - key #2. In the mid-90's Matthewson in all of their wisdom retooled their hydrant shafts to these massive square ones. It's copper! There's some pretty cool technology in the snowmaking industry. Highly-engineered. THe grandaddy of all was/is the Omichron snow gun. We actually would buy a trail with like 20-30 feet of snow. All Omichrons. Some Hedco fan guns for the base (which I ran for 2 years, quite boring). 


  Then the brilliant move to install yet again, upgraded hydrants. Like thousands. They had these screwed in hydrant keys. So no, you don't kneed them. Huh? What about the other 3 different sizes peppered on like thousands installed everywhere. But snowmakers are very good at creativity. Like planning over days pranks. A classic is to walk down after the team checks their guns. Give them like a 15 minute start. Then walk down the trail and turn each gun on another. Remember, they won't be back to check those guns for hours. Sometimes like 3-4 hours. 

  It's funny seeing burried guns staring at you. Gee, lots of fun digging snow by hand. Then ripping the Omichon (gently of course) out of the 7 foot pile of snow. So anyway, snowmakers sometimes love to permanently borrow things. Stuff that has value. Steel machinery that just dissapears overnight. Like $3000 worth of scrap steel vanishses instantly. Hmmmm...I wonder why you suddenly have a new Harley along with your $50,000 Ford F150? 

  Mostly the mechanics get dibs on those gems. Snowmakers do get to harness a dozen or so differnt hydrant keys in their lockers. Always stashed on the bottom with old blue coveralls on top. You'll break them from time-to-time. Or lose them. So this is why the hydrant key #4 isn't even an option once stolen. Now you have to turn up or turn down the water valve. With nothing but your handy dandy hydrant keys snug inside your Koflak boot gator. You need to wear gators on boots. The rubber kind. It keeps 100% snow out and the warm in. 

  Some dudes went with new plastic boots like some knock-off brand. They were purple. Dorky and poor manufacturing. The plastic was too soft and the treads were not stiff. 

  So finally, this page is the required suit up hydrant keys tool list for you to survive trading futures. It's fun and gets addicting in a good way.

  ><b>Best Times to Trade<b>
  
|Time of Day| Why? | Why Not? |

|4:59am|You get to get in early and watch 1 contract go up.|You get stopped out and miss gains. Oh well, no big deal. |
|6:59am|You get a possible 20-30 spike up.|You get crushed since you bought a call (Buy Mkt green button). Hope you had a $20-$30 stop in place. Maybe $50 if you want to give your trade some breathing room. |

  ><b>Trading Size of Contracts<b>

|Trade # of Contracts| Bad Part | Good Part |
|--|--|--|
|1|You miss out on gains.|You get to trade for more gains with more trades. You may only make $50 but that's good. Sell it and look at it.|
|2|You risk auto-liquidate and serious losses. Good for fast trades (like 8-20 seconds).|Your marign squeezes you forcing auto-liquidation of account (not good).|
|3|Big risk if you don't sell fast.|Great for long trades if you add 1 contract per 30% of your margin.|

|5|Same as #3 & 4.|Same as #3 & 4.|
|6-9|Massive risk and any spike up or down will auto-liquidate your stuff instantly.|Massive gains with like $1000. Could do 50% gain in less than a minute. Sell fast.|


Here's some easy stuff to read on the reasons to trade 1+ contracts:

|Trade # of Contracts| Bad Part | Good Part |
|--|--|--|
|1|You miss out on gains.|You get to trade for more gains with more trades. You may only make $50 but that's good. Sell it and look at it.|

|6-9|Massive risk and any spike up or down will auto-liquidate your stuff instantly.|Massive gains with like $1000. Could do 50% gain in less than a minute. Sell fast.|

Can you go more? Oh yes. If the margin is mellow, you can crank up to 15-20 contracts. Sometimes if the NQ is skyrocketing up, I'll go with 3 contracts. Then add 1 more every 10-20 points. It can pump up the volume so fast, you just keep adding 1 contract. It's faster than click the dropdown to add contracts like 2+. 

<b>Trading Tons of Contracts<b>

Play around with it in your replay. Add like $1000, then practice trading any part of any day. Take a trade with 5 contracts. Notice how fast you can be down $80. When you get it right, you'll be up $80 in seconds. Then $121. Then $253. Remember when you see those fast gains, sell fast. Take the money. You can always get back in for 5 more if it keeps going. But be very careful with puts (Sell Mkt red button). Those are bumpy rides. Avoid with extreme ignorance and you'll sustain brutal losses. 

<b>The Reasons I Write This Stuff<b>

Sometimes I ask myself the same question. For two reasons:

1. To document the devastating losses I get pummeled with in my cash account. Not fun and it creates ultimate madness feelings to keep writing about losing money. 
2. I do it for you. At this writing, this is free. Like no charge. No goofy message clubs, dumb training modules, and the endless prop firm goof offs. If (the jury is still out) you can turn your former addictions and obsessions with making money trading futures. 

Look at your day. Can you snag an hour less sleep a day to learn this stuff? Imagine 2-3 hours a day. Make it a game. Turn any fragment of your deep dark suspicious fantasies and use them to your advantage. 

Convert screen time and your silly social media scrolling to investing in yourself. Give it 30 days. Set-up a Tradovate.com account. Then pay for the Replay with CME data. It's like 50 bucks. 

Not sure how? Use Grok on X.com. Sometimes focussing on the real task at hand (learning to trade) rather than getting stuck in the weeds how to do it. Be smart. Set-up of Tradovate stuff should take maybe a few hours after your disclaimer and financial documentation completion.

You don't need much. Here's what Grok says...

> Capital Requirements for Opening a Tradovate Account, a futures
> trading platform, has straightforward capital requirements for account
> opening. Based on official and reliable sources, here's a
> breakdown:Key Capital Needs
> 
> -   No Minimum Deposit to Open a Live Account: Tradovate does not require any specific minimum funding amount to open or maintain a live

> process (which takes about 5 minutes) and open the account without
> depositing funds upfront.
> -   Funding to Start Trading: While no capital is needed to open the account, to place your first trade, you'll need sufficient funds to
> cover the day trading margin for the contract(s) you want to trade.
> For example:
>     -   Micro E-mini futures (e.g., /MES for Nasdaq) typically require around $50–$220 per contract for day trading margins (varies by
> contract and market conditions).
>     -   Standard E-mini futures (e.g., /ES) require about $500 per contract.
>     -   These margins are intraday only; holding positions overnight requires higher maintenance margins (e.g., ~$1,060 for a micro Nasdaq
> contract).
> -   Practical Recommendation: Many traders suggest starting with at least $250–$1,000 to cover margins for 1–4 contracts comfortably and
> avoid quick liquidation due to small price moves. This aligns with
> common advice for micro futures trading.

><b>Other Notes on Funding<b>
> 
> -   Minimum Deposit Thresholds by Method: Some funding options (e.g., certain wire transfers or initial setups) may have practical minimums

> -   Demo Accounts: Completely free—no capital required. Includes 14 days of live streaming data for practice.
> -   Funded Accounts (via Prop Firms): If pursuing a "funded" Tradovate account through a proprietary trading firm, requirements differ (e.g.,

<b>Have No Investing Brain?<b>

Cool. All the fewer bad habits to change. Newbies crush this stuff. Why? Mostly because they look at as a business. Then trade as if they're trading someone else's money. When you change your mindset to trading for someone else (your kids, parents, non-profit orgs) you get damn good at being cheap. 

Have you ever seen people who are experts at their job? Like they can do it in their sleep? That's pure breed expertise. 20,000-50,000 hours of time put in. They own what they do. 

That's the type of person that resides inside of yourself. Not sure? Fake it. Make a fantasy character in your head that trades with exceptional caution. Trades their replay account 10 hours a day. More after some strong cup of Joe. 

Take breaks. Watch your favorite episodes of Breaking Bad. Become the Jessie that's desperate to succeed regardless of the laws broken. There's a lot to learn if you think like Walt but have the personal gumption of Jessie. 

Add in those two dudes, Skinny Pete and Badger in your trading. They represent shiny other types of trades. Gosh, don't go trading gold. It moves damn slow and will drive you mad waiting for a $1 movement. Oil is interesting but again, sleeper. It's like watching your grass grow in August. 

After an hour or two break, go back and reply trade a different day. Master the day times like below:

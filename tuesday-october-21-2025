Today was bad. Like I lost $800. Not fun and yes, mistakes were made. Like whenever you notice the NQ is struggling to break 50 up is not a good thing. I was up like $200 early at around 8am. Then it dropped. then I exited. Then chased Sell Mkt (PUTs as in sell short) silly trades. But almost always, again, letting things fall and buy longs (Buy Mkt button) didn't fit into my attitude. I had $800. Tons of money. Buy 2-3 contracts and slowly move up. Like easy. Then instead of selling and taking the money (duh) I let it slide. Hmmm...pop up now. Nope. 

Below is a screenshot of today's train wreck:

<b>Lessons to Ponder<b>

These apply to me and you. 

1. Go very slow when you first get cash in your account to trade.
2. Buy only 1 contract (like no more than 1 in case you wonder).
3. Aim for $50 in profit, then sell. Then wait. Slow down. 
4. If you see a good trade, go for it but with a tight $10 stop.
5. Move your stops up manually. Some like auto-stops that trail the price by a factor like ticks, money, etc. 
6. Stop trading. Or just switch to your replay module and trade your trades again. It's a great way to learn. 
7. Write about your problems. We all got them. I have tons if anyone wants to buy some. Write about your good and bad.
8. Avoid thinking you got this stuff. You will get crushed. We all do. Go very slow. Use replay A LOT. Then MORE A LOT. 
9. Start trading your replay account immediately. Just get over it. You are paying through the school of hard knocks. 

<b>Move On Duh<b>
Forget about it. Tony said such to Christopher which was not as cool as Adriana's departure. Tough story to go with but they kept running out of ways to add depth to the characters. I did like the ending. Tough call. Black screen works though and forces viewers to see how Tone got loose with his standards. 

Keep trading. Every single day. Go for 5 hours. Break up your day. Do some time in the morning. Then around 3:15pm EST. Maybe dial in at night and watch things move slowly. Lotta money to be made overnight. 

I'm bummed but the $500 transfer into my account is on the way. I'll be trading cash on Thursday. Tomorrow I'll sim trade and get ready. 

Thanks for reading. Peace be with you all.

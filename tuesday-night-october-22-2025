So today was crazy wild. Hmmm...guess who's waiting for funds to hit my cash account? Ya, dummy me. I traded my Tradovate sim account. Got destroyed again with like $800. 

Kind of a funk lately. Like a lot. Writing about it definitely helps evaluate my silly choices. When the market tanks 50-100 points a minute, you WILL get destroyed. Like brutally auto-liquidated instantly if you go in heavy such as more than 1 contract either way.

In the afternoon I had some time so I did replay the massive drop. Turned $800 into like $3400. 

<b>Friday night October 24, 2025 Update<b>

I took off yesterday from trading. Needed a full unplug of all technology. Sometimes getting away from everything refuels your thinking. Like 24+ hour of device-free time. 

Then today I wake up, dive into my new $300 cash account. Boom, up $200. Then it dropped. Guess who lost the $300? 

It's tricky when you get caught up in 120 point spike in the morning. Early too, 7a. 1 contract would have done serious damage in the plus sign. That's why starting to trade around 5am is smart. 

So this week I'm down $1300. Ouch. It's added a new approach to my thinking. Like don't chase stuff, then add contracts, then another. Always, you get squeezed with margin. You're in the green up like $50. Then you get an alert saying your account is close to auto-liquidation. Huh? Yuppers. That's why again, giving myself my own advice, trade only 1 contract.

Here's some easy stuff to read on the reasons to trade 1+ contracts:

|Trade # of Contracts| Bad Part | Good Part |
|--|--|--|
|1|You miss out on gains.|You get to trade for more gains with more trades. You may only make $50 but that's good. Sell it and look at it.|
|2|You risk auto-liquidate and serious losses. Good for fast trades (like 8-20 seconds).|Your marign squeezes you forcing auto-liquidation of account (not good).|
|3|Big risk if you don't sell fast.|Great for long trades if you add 1 contract per 30% of your margin.|
|4|Same as #3.|Same as #3.|
|5|Same as #3 & 4.|Same as #3 & 4.|
|6-9|Massive risk and any spike up or down will auto-liquidate your stuff instantly.|Massive gains with like $1000. Could do 50% gain in less than a minute. Sell fast.|

Can you go more? Oh yes. If the margin is mellow, you can crank up to 15-20 contracts. Sometimes if the NQ is skyrocketing up, I'll go with 3 contracts. Then add 1 more every 10-20 points. It can pump up the volume so fast, you just keep adding 1 contract. It's faster than click the dropdown to add contracts like 2+. 

<b>Trading Tons of Contracts<b>

Play around with it in your replay. Add like $1000, then practice trading any part of any day. Take a trade with 5 contracts. Notice how fast you can be down $80. When you get it right, you'll be up $80 in seconds. Then $121. Then $253. Remember when you see those fast gains, sell fast. Take the money. You can always get back in for 5 more if it keeps going. But be very careful with puts (Sell Mkt red button). Those are bumpy rides. Avoid with extreme ignorance and you'll sustain brutal losses. 

<b>The Reasons I Write This Stuff<b>

Sometimes I ask myself the same question. For two reasons:

1. To document the devastating losses I get pummeled with in my cash account. Not fun and it creates ultimate madness feelings to keep writing about losing money. 
2. I do it for you. At this writing, this is free. Like no charge. No goofy message clubs, dumb training modules, and the endless prop firm goof offs. If (the jury is still out) you can turn your former addictions and obsessions with making money trading futures. 

Look at your day. Can you snag an hour less sleep a day to learn this stuff? Imagine 2-3 hours a day. Make it a game. Turn any fragment of your deep dark suspicious fantasies and use them to your advantage. 

Convert screen time and your silly social media scrolling to investing in yourself. Give it 30 days. Set-up a Tradovate.com account. Then pay for the Replay with CME data. It's like 50 bucks. 

Not sure how? Use Grok on X.com. Sometimes focussing on the real task at hand (learning to trade) rather than getting stuck in the weeds how to do it. Be smart. Set-up of Tradovate stuff should take maybe a few hours after your disclaimer and financial documentation completion.

You don't need much. Here's what Grok says...

> Capital Requirements for Opening a Tradovate Account, a futures
> trading platform, has straightforward capital requirements for account
> opening. Based on official and reliable sources, here's a
> breakdown:Key Capital Needs
> 
> -   No Minimum Deposit to Open a Live Account: Tradovate does not require any specific minimum funding amount to open or maintain a live
> individual futures trading account. You can complete the application
> process (which takes about 5 minutes) and open the account without
> depositing funds upfront.
> -   Funding to Start Trading: While no capital is needed to open the account, to place your first trade, you'll need sufficient funds to
> cover the day trading margin for the contract(s) you want to trade.
> For example:
>     -   Micro E-mini futures (e.g., /MES for Nasdaq) typically require around $50–$220 per contract for day trading margins (varies by
> contract and market conditions).
>     -   Standard E-mini futures (e.g., /ES) require about $500 per contract.
>     -   These margins are intraday only; holding positions overnight requires higher maintenance margins (e.g., ~$1,060 for a micro Nasdaq
> contract).
> -   Practical Recommendation: Many traders suggest starting with at least $250–$1,000 to cover margins for 1–4 contracts comfortably and
> avoid quick liquidation due to small price moves. This aligns with
> common advice for micro futures trading.

> Other Notes on Funding
> 
> -   Minimum Deposit Thresholds by Method: Some funding options (e.g., certain wire transfers or initial setups) may have practical minimums
> like $5, but this doesn't affect account opening.
> -   Demo Accounts: Completely free—no capital required. Includes 14 days of live streaming data for practice.
> -   Funded Accounts (via Prop Firms): If pursuing a "funded" Tradovate account through a proprietary trading firm, requirements differ (e.g.,
> $250 minimum for micro futures eligibility), but this is separate from
> opening a standard Tradovate account.

> For the most current details, visit Tradovate's official funding

<b>Have No Investing Brain?<b>

Cool. All the fewer bad habits to change. Newbies crush this stuff. Why? Mostly because they look at as a business. Then trade as if they're trading someone else's money. When you change your mindset to trading for someone else (your kids, parents, non-profit orgs) you get damn good at being cheap. 

Have you ever seen people who are experts at their job? Like they can do it in their sleep? That's pure breed expertise. 20,000-50,000 hours of time put in. They own what they do. 

That's the type of person that resides inside of yourself. Not sure? Fake it. Make a fantasy character in your head that trades with exceptional caution. Trades their replay account 10 hours a day. More after some strong cup of Joe. 

Take breaks. Watch your favorite episodes of Breaking Bad. Become the Jessie that's desperate to succeed regardless of the laws broken. There's a lot to learn if you think like Walt but have the personal gumption of Jessie. 

Add in those two dudes, Skinny Pete and Badger in your trading. They represent shiny other types of trades. Gosh, don't go trading gold. It moves damn slow and will drive you mad waiting for a $1 movement. Oil is interesting but again, sleeper. It's like watching your grass grow in August. 

After an hour or two break, go back and reply trade a different day. Master the day times like below:

|Time of Day| Why? | Why Not? |
|--|--|--|
|4:59am|You get to get in early and watch 1 contract go up.|You get stopped out and miss gains. Oh well, no big deal. |
|6:59am|You get a possible 20-30 spike up.|You get crushed since you bought a call (Buy Mkt green button). Hope you had a $20-$30 stop in place. Maybe $50 if you want to give your trade some breathing room. |
|9:57am|A good place to buy 1 contract and get a good spike up like 20+ points.|Way too much risk of a bad spike the wrong way. But manageable and worth the risk of huge gains. Remember to sell fast. |
|  10:01am |The 10am news and orders are done. Phew. Now you have yourself some kind of direction. Could be 50+ points your way. That's money. Sell fast. |You prayed it would go up and it drops 73 points. You get stopped out and the buy a put. But the NQ spikes up almost always after massive spikes. Those are good ones to trade for like 10 seconds. Then sell wicked fast.  
|  11:01am |To be bored and see how sloggy it moves up and down 10 points. It will always crush you. Good learning experience.|You'll pay ton of commissions getting second-guessed which way it's heading. Best to refer to 5 and 30 minute charts in this situation. |

So today was crazy wild. Hmmm...guess who's waiting for funds to hit my cash account? Ya, dummy me. I traded my Tradovate sim account. Got destroyed again with like $800. 

Kind of a funk lately. Like a lot. Writing about it definitely helps evaluate my silly choices. When the market tanks 50-100 points a minute, you WILL get destroyed. Like brutally auto-liquidated instantly if you go in heavy such as more than 1 contract either way.

In the afternoon I had some time so I did replay the massive drop. Turned $800 into like $3400.

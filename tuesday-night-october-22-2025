So today was crazy wild. Hmmm...guess who's waiting for funds to hit my cash account? Ya, dummy me. I traded my Tradovate sim account. Got destroyed again with like $800. 

Kind of a funk lately. Like a lot. Writing about it definitely helps evaluate my silly choices. When the market tanks 50-100 points a minute, you WILL get destroyed. Like brutally auto-liquidated instantly if you go in heavy such as more than 1 contract either way.

In the afternoon I had some time so I did replay the massive drop. Turned $800 into like $3400. 

<b>Friday night October 24, 2025 Update<b>

I took off yesterday from trading. Needed a full unplug of all technology. Sometimes getting away from everything refuels your thinking. Like 24+ hour of device-free time. 

Then today I wake up, dive into my new $300 cash account. Boom, up $200. Then it dropped. Guess who lost the $300? 

It's tricky when you get caught up in 120 point spike in the morning. Early too, 7a. 1 contract would have done serious damage in the plus sign. That's why starting to trade around 5am is smart. 

So this week I'm down $1300. Ouch. It's added a new approach to my thinking. Like don't chase stuff, then add contracts, then another. Always, you get squeezed with margin. You're in the green up like $50. Then you get an alert saying your account is close to auto-liquidation. Huh? Yuppers. That's why again, giving myself my own advice, trade only 1 contract.

Here's some easy stuff to read on the reasons to trade 1+ contracts:

|Trade # of Contracts| Bad Part | Good Part |
|--|--|--|
|1|You miss out on gains.|You get to trade for more gains with more trades. You may only make $50 but that's good. Sell it and look at it.|
|2|You risk auto-liquidate and serious losses. Good for fast trades (like 8-20 seconds).|Your marign squeezes you forcing auto-liquidation of account (not good).|
|3|Big risk if you don't sell fast.|Great for long trades if you add 1 contract per 30% of your margin.|
|4|Same as #3.|Same as #3.|
|5|Same as #3 & 4.|Same as #3 & 4.|
|6-9|Massive risk and any spike up or down will auto-liquidate your stuff instantly.|Massive gains with like $1000. Could do 50% gain in less than a minute. Sell fast.|

Can you go more? Oh yes. If the margin is mellow, you can crank up to 15-20 contracts. Sometimes if the NQ is skyrocketing up, I'll go with 3 contracts. Then add 1 more every 10-20 points. It can pump up the volume so fast, you just keep adding 1 contract. It's faster than click the dropdown to add contracts like 2+. 

<b>Trading Tons of Contracts<b>

Play around with it in your replay. Add like $1000, then practice trading any part of any day. Take a trade with 5 contracts. Notice how fast you can be down $80. When you get it right, you'll be up $80 in seconds. Then $121. Then $253. Remember when you see those fast gains, sell fast. Take the money. You can always get back in for 5 more if it keeps going. But be very careful with puts (Sell Mkt red button). Those are bumpy rides. Avoid with extreme ignorance and you'll sustain brutal losses.

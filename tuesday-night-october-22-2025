So today was crazy wild. Hmmm...guess who's waiting for funds to hit my cash account? Ya, dummy me. I traded my Tradovate sim account. Got destroyed again with like $800. 

Kind of a funk lately. Like a lot. Writing about it definitely helps evaluate my silly choices. When the market tanks 50-100 points a minute, you WILL get destroyed. Like brutally auto-liquidated instantly if you go in heavy such as more than 1 contract either way.

In the afternoon I had some time so I did replay the massive drop. Turned $800 into like $3400.

I took off yesterday from trading. Needed a full unplug of all technology. Sometimes getting away from everything refuels your thinking. Like 24+ hour of device-free time. 

Then today I wake up, dive into my new $300 cash account. Boom, up $200. Then it dropped. Guess who lost the $300? 

It's tricky when you get caught up in 120 point spike in the morning. Early too, 7a. 1 contract would have done serious damage in the plus sign. That's why starting to trade around 5am is smart. 

So this week I'm down $1300. Ouch. It's added a new approach to my thinking. Like don't chase stuff, then add contracts, then another. Always, you get squeezed with margin. You're in the green up like $50. Then you get an alert saying your account is close to auto-liquidation. Huh? Yuppers. That's why again, giving myself my own advice, trade only 1 contract.

Here's some easy stuff to read:

|Trade 1 Contract| Bad Part | Good Part |

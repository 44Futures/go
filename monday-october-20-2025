# Monday October 20, 2025

Hey there. It's Monday and that means hmmmm on the NQ. Even with earnings week oozing our way, Mondays are a tricky trading day. A lot of the time it's because things on Monday tend to fall. Like a lot. Not always but often.

Wait, there's more...

Being a believer in up, up, and away, there are many trades like BUY ones that can snag you some decent quick gains. But they tend to be short so get in and then get out fast. Take the money. A wise person told me years ago that Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays can be tough. Thursdays and Fridays tend to deliver big moves. But with earnings week(s), a lot of that can be tossed out with the Wednesday curbside garbage. So do you plan for these types of traditional slug feasts? Nope. So much of my trading on the NQ (cash and replay) are based on the retail trading market. Then add in a dose of hedge funds tossing millions of contracts into the fun and bingo. You get volume and direction. Oh ya, that is what I love. 

Right now at 5:56am EST I am up +19.25 on the MESZ5. Hmmmm, huh? M is for mini. ES is the S&P 500. Z is the contract expiration which is December. 5 is the year. I'm in on my demo account now waiting for cash to hit my account. Why am I trading the MES? Well, I got stoked on MNQ (mini NQ) after last night's silly drop at around 6:45pm EST. Lost some coinage so I switched to the MES since it's cheaper to buy 1 or 2 contracts with a $100. At this writing I'm up $65 on 2 contracts. Looking to break even today. I started with $800. Bought a few MNQ contracts and sat watching. Tightened my stops. Then they triggered me out. Bummer. So trading the MES is a great place to start when you're down on your luck. The MES moves slow. It's like a chill day at the beach. Things go slow and almost makes you wonder if anyone in the world is trading the MES. Yuppers, billions of contracts trade the MES. It's the bedrock financial dealio that drives other markets. My issue trading the MES is that the price ranges are low. Sure you can snag some comfort trading with millions of others on the MES. There's some safety there and it's a cool place to dabble in learning to trade futures. But for me, I prefer the massive price spikes on the MNQ. They tend to make and break traders. Almost always break. Seldom do traders make gains on the MNQ or the NQ without catastrophic losses. 

><b>Tip<b>
When I started trading options back in 2018 with IB, it took about a month to understand what was going on. Like wow, all this stuff in my face, lots of charts to learn about and then there's changing your charts or even better. Deleting most of them. Give yourself a month to learn about your brokerage trading platform. Also, don't trade on your phone app. It's a bad idea and you miss the price action details that trading on your desktop app offers. Be smart. Don't be dumb and trade on your phone.

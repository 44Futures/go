# Go 44Futures

Welcome to this insane place that is driven by brutal losses over 8 years. Good times minus the cash. So here is the scoop. Everything I write here is based on my personal trading experience. That's it. Oh, but it gets better. I don't trade using any of the following:

|Dumb Metric  | Why Not?|
|--|--|
|Stochastics|They are trend lines. Who cares when the NQ just spiked 40 points in 33 seconds.|
|Order flow|Another gimmick. They bounce up and down like 30 points from real time prices. Weird|
|Insane prop firms|Great concept. Well, until you spike your account 40% in a day.|
|Too late alerts|A nice try. But when things spike margin requirements reduce what you can buy.|
|Chaty chat rooms|I'd rather hang out at the YMCA than listen to the banter. Please.|

What I use are the following:

|Smart | Why|
|--|--|
|CME-4 Data|This connects you with the juice that gets you access to live trading stuff. You need it so buy it. Cheap, like around $50 or so with Tradovate. I spent a long time (years) with just that plan and using their Replay module. Go back, trade bad days. Huge days. Slow days. Learn the patterns of a trading day. Plus notice how your margin can crush you and your smart trades instantly. Start with 1 contract. Try to not crash your $800 balance. Turn it into a game instead of play dorky games online. Hook up with friends and family and dare to compare who can 2X their account in a day. Heck, start a game where the losers have to shovel the winners driveways all winter. That's leverage my friends.|
|Smart Pipes  |Because you can see horizontal price movement. Then find hooks. Slides are also common. Gap up or down during the transition to the next minute. Boom, slide up $1.02. Ya, that works well if you have Bulls vs. Bears.|
|Bulls vs. Bears|Busted, now you know my secret. The dorky Bulls vs. Bears chart. I run it on the bottom and you will (if you watch long enough) how prices pop up (sometimes down) like confetti. It's seems like a mathematical presentation of the code managing the UI CSS. Seems like a ton of code and testing. Tradovate is my home central for futures trading.|
|One Screen|You don't need all those dorking sidebar charts. Get rid of all that crap and have two things. The chart of the NQ (always helps) and cash in your account. Well, a third really if you count Bulls vs. Bears running your Tradovate account.|
|Tough Chair| Get a decent chair. I just snagged a stiffer one that is good. If there is interest, I will share my current workstation tricks for ulimate comformt. The kind that allows you to kick back and trade without all the dumb tradtional desks.|
|iMac Computer| I run an old 2018 used iMac. OS maybe 11. It's got 16 gigs of ram and a smoking fast modem. You want the best Internet you can get. Timing is everything. Although when the local Internet goes out, I have traded with Tradovate using my cellphone hot spot. Works pretty good in desperate times.|
|One Screen| You know, like you don't need 4 huge monster screens. I trade on my iMac 27" and it is perfect. Forget about distractions. Focus on price. Lots of watching how the last ten seconds of a minute creates some direction. Hmmmm...maybe look for those and get good at spotting them maybe? That is just one way to trade.|

<b>Slow Down<b>
That's enough for now. At some point I think I may do some videos of my live trading. I am currently hooked on the MNQ. The mini thing for those of you wondering huh? The mini is a tiny fragment of the real NQ (NASDAQ). Street lingo means you get to buy some stuff like one or two things for cheap money. Like $100. Pretty sweet deal if you don't stop watching it. 

<b>Tight Stops<b>
I went no stops for years. That's not ideal when you like money. That's an entirely long bad story covering about 6 years of testing. The results were not cool and the losses exceeded $150,000 over 8 years. Maybe more. 

<b>Why Bother?<b>
When you lose truckloads of cash over years, you begin to wonder if you are mad. Like gambling. It's something my son brought up to me a while back. Dad, he said, it's gambling. He's right. But gambling doesn't allow you to control risk. You risk it all buying a ticket. Trading futures comes with controlled risk. Don't like a trade and you want out? Click, out in 1 second. That's whey you want to use Tradovate (or Ninja) for all your trading.

Here's why...

Say that perhaps 50,000 orders flow into the NQ at once. Like get us all out of this plummeting pile of molten lava now. Sell it all, not now, but NOW!!! Guess what? The servers can't handle all of that traffic. So they throttle the traffic of their APIs so that only a certain threshold of customrs (hmmmm...the big firms) can process orders. 

You get stuck with some Robinhood in wreckage brokerage and your orders won't get filled. Oops, the servers are down. Oops, we removed the SELL button from our app. Listen folks, I work in the software industry. Stuff doesn't disappear. It's shocking to me that the average retail trader still doesn't see that responding to any advertising for trading is a bad idea. Almost all of them are designed to stop you out trades, squeeze you on marge (bye bye all your cash), or worse. Jack you high volume margin rates. 

Tradovate is almost always on. Like over the last 4 years, I have been with Tradovate. Maybe 4 times in those 4 years did their application (desktop) freeze and crash. I trade about 7-10 hours a day. 100% of the time I'm trading with the desktop application using Tradovate. Go elsewhere if you want. Interactive Brokers is good. Very good. I traded SPY options with them for about 4 years. Their fills are instant. Like half a second to get your order filled. That is fast. I'm not thrilled nor was I when they added the no 'free riding' clause into their brokerage agreement. So if I made $500 and my account was at a balance of $1000, they suddenly wouldn't allow me to trade the $1000. Hmmmm...I did it for years. That's when I decided to move to futures. 

<b>Why Futures<b>
There are tons of books out there why to trade futures. Far too many experts who waste all your time on chart patterns. Boring old snooze news that does nothing for you right now. Like now. Not in ten seconds. That's the problem with all training programs excluding Randall Hudgen's courses.

Prop firms are an interesting bunch. They give you cheap access to test money. But read through their requirements for day trading. They want long-term pattern traders. Not scalping futures traders. So they throttle your access or downright lock down your account for a violation of their rules. Then you have to pay another fee to unlock your account. Then go for the long-haul traders. They can work but plan on being mighty slow and steay. Those types of buy at the bottom of 5 minute chart and hold with a proper stop plan. It can work. But then read the redemption rules. They are tight and do make sense from their business side. But at what point do you think to yourself, I could just spend $50 a month with Tradovate and do tons of market replaces. Dial in on the afternoon, replay that day's market. Make it your new addiction. You'll learn a ton about how to be tough and achieve some financial independence. Give it a year and you'll be a life. 

The cool thing about trading futures is you get to tap into the complixities and sneak stuff that drives all trading courtesy of our friends in the U.K. markets. Plus you can trade almost 24 hours a day. Some great trades start at 4am EST. Like lots. Imagine buying 1 CALL (so that stuff goes up and you make money) and having it go up 120 points. It happens. 5am is good but 7a is a great place to start. Hmmmm...that sure seems like when the U.K. markets trade. 

Another gem that should peak your interest is that it's cheap. Who cares if you don't have cash in your account. Just go bananas using Replay. Set your time (6:59am) and drop like $800 in your pretend money account (a.k.a. simulation trading). Then buy 1 contract. See what happens. We can coach you up on stops soon. Like real soon. 

Wait, it gets even better...

Not advisable but if you notice the market is catapulting up as you're in line at Dunkin Donuts listening to the radio (go Pats), fire up your Tradovate phone app. Buy 1 contract. Make some money and sell. Get out fast. Take the money. What are you not getting?

<b>Beware<b>
The entire trading industry is rampant on predicting trends. They usually miss the timing of the spike or worse. Their users in their instant alert message thingies also miss out on what is actually happening now. Like in real-time. So how do you not get it that if you watch the patterns of a trading day you can access to trade set-up.s

So beware where you read and what you believe to be true. I'm a mixed bag. Grew up in the mountains of NH making snow. For a long time like 13 years. Then worked at Saco Bound for 13 spring, summer, and fall fun times. Like for no money. Maybe starting at $275 a week (gross). When I first started making snow I was making $5 an hour at King Pine in 1985. We were broke but we had friendships that last a lifetime. Great people. 

Another beware of total devastation of your cash is by risking it. Don't put any money into your Tradovate account. Relax, slow down there you soon-to-be futures trading addict. Give trading futures like a month with using just the Replay module. Start with $800. Go wild and try and trade the opening bell. Yikes, talk about a zig zag up and down nightmare. You're up like $150 in a second. Then the NQ drops 50 points in seconds. Bye, bye your trade. Plus you got auto-liquidated which demolishes your account balance to like $-6.12. I've had it happen. Oops. Sorry margin Gods. 

This can go on and on with the beware stuff. You can drive to work tomorrow and breakdown. Now you got a big car bill. That's risk. When you trade your demo/replay/sim/simulation/paper trading account (phew, I know, long list), there is never a broken down car involved with any of your trades. Bummer since sometimes a Cumberland Farms big coffee keeps your eyes working. They have some good coffee and great cashiers. Mine is a good guy, always up for some tongue and cheek keep it under 100 M.P.H. type chatter. 

So compare the risk of you life and what you do before you say, ah, trading futures doesn't work. Well, neither did driving when you were a kid. You sucked at it like the rest of us. My Dad taught me to drive a VW Bug stick. Great times jerking around the car for a few weeks with my Dad pissed off. Let's go home he'd say. That was his nice way of telling me the Sox game was about to come on the radio so enough of this shit. 

<b>Why I Trade<b>
It's a calucated goldmine if you get good. Give it three months. Trade at least 4 hours a day. Then 6. Then 8. Dial up the overnight screens. Notice how the NQ creeps up. Slow and stead. Sometimes you get a 10-30 point drop, then up again. Check out the 5 and 30 minute charts. Notice anything? Hopefully you're saying to yourself huh? 

This stuff takes time. I have about 15,000 hours trading time here at happy acres. If you dare dive into this goofy stuff, I promise you a few things...

1. I'll share gains and losses.
2. You'll see quickly how all the hype is a waste of time.
3. Next, you'll notice trading around news can destroy your account.
4. Later on when you're ready, you'll take a train ride on the 3:15pm bonanza.
5. Perhaps you'll start trading your cash account and freak out. Cool, it happens.
6. Eventually, you'll notice this is fun. Like almost predictable. Oh, cool too.
7. You'll figure out quickly if you like it or hating it. Either way, you'll laugh.

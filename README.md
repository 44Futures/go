# Go 44Futures

Welcome to this insane place that is driven by brutal losses over 8 years. Good times minus the cash. So here is the scoop. Everything I write here is based on my personal trading experience. That's it. Oh, but it gets better. I don't trade using any of the following:

|Dumb Metric  | Why Not?|
|--|--|
|Stochastics|They are trend lines. Who cares when the NQ just spiked 40 points in 33 seconds.|
|Order flow|Another gimmick. They bounce up and down like 30 points from real time prices. Weird|
|Insane prop firms|Great concept. Well, until you spike your account 40% in a day.|
|Too late alerts|A nice try. But when things spike margin requirements reduce what you can buy.|
|Chaty chat rooms|I'd rather hang out at the YMCA than listen to the banter. Please.|

What I use are the following:

|Cool Stuff  | Why|
|--|--|
|Smart Pipes  |Because you can see horizontal price movement. Then find hooks. Slides are also common. Gap up or down during the transition to the next minute. Boom, slide up $1.02. Ya, that works well if you have Bulls vs. Bears.|
|Bulls vs. Bears|Busted, now you know my secret. The dorky Bulls vs. Bears chart. I run it on the bottom and you will (if you watch long enough) how prices pop up (sometimes down) like confetti. It's seems like a mathematical presentation of the code managing the UI CSS. Seems like a ton of code and testing. Tradovate is my home central for futures trading.|
|One Screen|You don't need all those dorking sidebar charts. Get rid of all that crap and have two things. The chart of the NQ (always helps) and cash in your account. Well, a third really if you count Bulls vs. Bears running your Tradovate account.|
